# Game Design's Tacoyaki+ Recreation
Quick and simple recreation of Game Design's Tacoyaki+ game using JavaScript and html. A work in progress that has two modes: the "regular" game mode where you invert a square and all of its neighbors to make the grid entirely blue or yellow, and a "behind the scenes" mode where you can view the moves used to generate the grid. Game represents modulo 2 addition and is a twist on the Lights Out electronic game.

NOTE: If you switch into inverse mode and then switch back, the game resets to prevent cheating
